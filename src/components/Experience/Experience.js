I learned a lot about marine biology and had great interactions with the guests informing them about wildlife conservation efforts. My favorite exhibits at the Tennessee Aquarium were the Coral Reef, Fresh Water Tank, and the Penguins.
                                    Note: Acceptance to this program is very competitive requiring an extended application and an interview process.

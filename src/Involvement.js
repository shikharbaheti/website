                                    I learned how to solve software and hardware issues for Texas A&M Health Science Center which encompass 3 buildings staffed with more than 500 employees and 2000 students.
                                    I learned how to work in a team setting effectively communicating tasks and information in a fast-paced environment. Learned technical IT support knowledge such as how to image computers, encrypt and decrypt using AirWatch, setup DUO authentication, remotely assist users through BOMGAR, utilizing an Active Directory, etc. I am now proficient in utilizing the ServiceNow ticketing system. I assisted, on an average, about 20 users a day with technical troubleshooting at the help desk and answered phone calls to remotely assist users.

                                    As a Youth Volunteer at the Tennessee Aquarium, I guided visitors through various exhibits of the aquarium and demonstrated excellent customer service. I learned a lot about marine biology and had great interactions with the guests informing them about wildlife conservation efforts. My favorite exhibits at the Tennessee Aquarium were the Coral Reef, Fresh Water Tank, and the Penguins.

                                    The Student Engineers' Council is one of the oldest organizations on campus as it was founded by the Dean of Engineering in 1939. We act as a representative body for all 15,000 engineering students at Texas A&M. With a huge focus on community and engineering development, we organize and host numerous events throughout the year with the most prominent one being the Engineering Career Fair - the largest career fair in the country. Working along with Sys Admin Council in the SEC, I have had the opportunity to innovate and maintain various SEC websites such as MembershipHub, FinanceHub, Career Fair, website, etc. These websites are used by over 1500 students every month and are integral to the functioning of the SEC.

                                    I was selected from over 600 engineering student applicants be a member of the Zachry Leadership Program. The Zachry Leadership Program is a partnership between the College of Engineering at Texas A&M University and the Zachry Group. The founding premise of the five-semester program is that technical knowledge alone is insufficient to prepare engineering graduates to make the high-impact contributions needed in todayâ€™s rapidly changing world. Maximizing your potential requires holistic development, a broader and deeper level of personal awareness and enhanced leadership skills. Selection to this program is highly competitive and consists of 5 mandatory pre-semester retreats and a 5 semester classes.

As a Committee Leader in the Operations Sub committee, I assisted with the putting up the "Gala" event to raise funds for The Big Event to buy tools and better our processes. Moreover, I led a team of 6 partners to complete job checks at various residents in B/CS area.
